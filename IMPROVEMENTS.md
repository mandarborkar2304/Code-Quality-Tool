# Code Quality Tool Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Code Quality Tool application to address various issues and enhance functionality.

## 1. API Optimization

### Issues Addressed:
- Multiple redundant API calls for syntax checking
- Inefficient caching mechanisms
- No proper rate limiting handling
- Potential race conditions in API calls

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Robust Caching System**: Implemented a TTL-based cache in `apiCache.ts` to prevent redundant API calls
- **Request Queue**: Created a queue system in `apiUtils.ts` to manage concurrent requests and prevent rate limiting
- **Retry Mechanism**: Added exponential backoff retry logic for failed API calls
- **Debouncing**: Implemented debouncing for API calls to reduce unnecessary requests

## 2. Monaco Editor Improvements

### Issues Addressed:
- Theme inconsistency when switching between light/dark modes
- Syntax highlighting sometimes fails to update
- Editor size doesn't always adapt correctly to container

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Theme Synchronization**: Enhanced theme handling with proper state tracking and forced re-rendering when needed
- **Editor Initialization**: Improved the editor mounting process with better state management
- **Responsive Layout**: Created a responsive layout system that adapts to different screen sizes

## 3. Error Handling

### Issues Addressed:
- Inconsistent error handling across components
- Some errors are silently caught without user feedback
- No retry mechanism for failed API calls

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Consistent Error Strategy**: Created a centralized error handling system in `errorHandling.ts`
- **Typed Errors**: Implemented typed errors for different error categories (API, Validation, Network, etc.)
- **User Feedback**: Added toast notifications for all errors with appropriate messages
- **Retry Capability**: Included retry functionality for recoverable errors

## 4. State Management

### Issues Addressed:
- Prop drilling across multiple components
- Inconsistent state updates
- Potential memory leaks from uncleared effects

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Context API**: Created an `EditorContext` to centralize state management
- **Custom Hooks**: Implemented custom hooks for shared functionality
- **Effect Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup for all effects to prevent memory leaks
- **Optimized Updates**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## 5. Performance Improvements

### Issues Addressed:
- Unnecessary re-renders in components
- Large bundle size affecting load time
- No code splitting for better performance

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented dynamic imports and lazy loading for heavy components
- **Memoization**: Used React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized Rendering**: Improved component structure to minimize render cycles
- **Suspense**: Added Suspense boundaries for better loading states

## 6. UI/UX Improvements

### Issues Addressed:
- Inconsistent UI elements and styling
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- No keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Solutions Implemented:
- **Responsive Layout**: Created a `ResponsiveLayout` component that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Added keyboard shortcuts for common actions:
  - Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter: Analyze code
  - Ctrl+S / Cmd+S: Check syntax
  - Ctrl+T / Cmd+T: Generate tests
  - Ctrl+R / Cmd+R: Reset editor
- **Shortcuts Help**: Added a keyboard shortcuts help dialog
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improved layout and controls for mobile devices

## How to Use the New Features

### API Caching and Optimization
The caching system works automatically in the background. No user action is required to benefit from these improvements.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Press **Ctrl+Enter** (or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to analyze code
- Press **Ctrl+S** (or Cmd+S on Mac) to check syntax
- Press **Ctrl+T** (or Cmd+T on Mac) to generate tests
- Press **Ctrl+R** (or Cmd+R on Mac) to reset the editor

Click the keyboard icon in the header to view all available shortcuts.

### Responsive Layout
The application now automatically adapts to different screen sizes:
- On desktop: Editor and analysis panel are shown side by side
- On mobile: A toggle allows switching between editor and analysis views

### Context-Based State Management
To use the new context-based implementation, navigate to `/editor-context` instead of the regular `/editor` route.
